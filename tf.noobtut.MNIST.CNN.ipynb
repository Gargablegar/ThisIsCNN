    "## Weight Initialization\n",
    "To create this model, we're going to need to create a lot of weights and biases. One should generally initialize weights with a small amount of noise for symmetry breaking, and to prevent 0 gradients. Since we're using ReLU neurons, it is also good practice to initialize them with a slightly positive initial bias to avoid \"dead neurons\". Instead of doing this repeatedly while we build the model, let's create two handy functions to do it for us.\n",

In this example, we're always going to choose the vanilla version. Our convolutions uses a stride of one and are zero padded so that the output is the same size as the input. Our pooling is plain old max pooling over 2x2 blocks. To keep our code cleaner, let's also abstract those operations into functions."
